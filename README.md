| Algorithm |     Result       | Time (seconds)|
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
|Dynamic func|{10: 1, 2: 1}|0.000005|
|Greedy func|{10: 1, 2: 1}|0.000001|

# Greedy faster than dynamic 
Greedy algorithm is faster by 0.000004 seconds
Speed-up factor: 4.79x

## Conclusions
- Both algorithms found the same result

### Recommendation
Use greedy approach (faster and better/equal result)
